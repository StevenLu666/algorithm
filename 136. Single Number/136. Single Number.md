# [Easy] 136. Single Number

Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example 1:
```
Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1
Example 2:
```
```
Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

## My solutions

1. As a C++ programmer, it's easy to find out the XOR is a good way to get the single number. The time complexity is O(1), and the space complexity is O(1) as well.

2. Also, we could use hash map to solve this problem. The time complexity is O(1), the space complexity is better than O(n).
